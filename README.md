# Minimum length Nozzle_design
Solve for the isentropic nozzle geometry, based on the method of characteristics (MOC), and written in Matlab.

Input: area ratio - between exit and throat
Set initial value on area ratio depending on combustion chamber pressure. 
Inputs:
- gamma : Specific heat ratio
- Ae_At : Area ratio of nozzle [Note: This is basically the diameter ratio and not the area ratio in the code!!]
