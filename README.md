# Minimum length Nozzle_design
Solve for the isentropic nozzle geometry, based on the method of characteristics (MOC), and written in Matlab.

% Input: area ratio
% Set initial value on area ratio 
% depending on combustion chamber pressure. 
% Inputs:
% - gamma     : Specific heat ratio []
% - Ae_At : Area ratio of nozzle []
